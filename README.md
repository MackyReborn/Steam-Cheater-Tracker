# Steam-Cheater-Tracker
Python Steam Account Tracker

This is a utility to track potential cheaters. It is tailored towards Counter-Strike: Global Offensive but can work in any game.

If this won't run due to valve package not being installed, please open git bash and type: ```pip install python-valve```

WIP:
  Adding more features to list clients,
  automatically getting permenant steam links for clients,
  integrating the Steam API.
